`About the Project`
It will be a Open Source online Store creator tool, that will make any business with an internet connection to get up and running with their own online store within 10 minutes.

`Main featues`

- Many templates to choose from
- Can customize everything from colors to store name and html meta data, products etc
- The data will be stored in their own firebase account with Google's trust and Security.

# Current Progress

---

- The first template is being built now.
- It is being built as a full scale e-commerce application now but later we will introduce dynamical components here.
- And slowly after learning from this we will make other templates much quicker.

# Prerequisites for working in this repo

`Softwares and technologies`

1. Open any Code Editor
2. In your Terminal/Shell/Command Promt navigate to the root project folder
3. Run command

```sh
    Yarn install
```

This will install all the dependencies.
4. You are Up and Running with this now.
5. To test your code locally you need to run
